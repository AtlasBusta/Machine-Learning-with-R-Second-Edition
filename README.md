**Discover how to build machine learning algorithms, prepare data, and dig deep into data prediction techniques with R**

## What is this book about?
Updated and upgraded to the latest libraries and most modern thinking, Machine Learning with R, Second Edition provides you with a rigorous introduction to this essential skill of professional data science. Without shying away from technical theory, it is written to provide focused and practical knowledge to get you building algorithms and crunching your data, with minimal previous experience.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Harness the power of R to build common machine learning algorithms with real-world data science applications 
* Get to grips with R techniques to clean and prepare your data for analysis, and visualize your results 
* Discover the different types of machine learning models and learn which is best to meet your data needs and solve your analysis problems 
* Classify your data with Bayesian and nearest neighbor methods 
* Predict values by using R to build decision trees, rules, and support vector machines 
Forecast numeric values with linear regression, and model your data with neural networks 
Evaluate and improve the performance of machine learning models 
Learn specialized machine learning techniques for text mining, social network data, big data, and more

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
subject_name, temperature, flu_status, gender, blood_type
John Doe, 98.1, FALSE, MALE, O 
Jane Doe, 98.6, FALSE, FEMALE, AB
Steve Graves, 101.4, TRUE, MALE, A
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is intended for anybody hoping to use data for action. Perhaps you already know a bit about machine learning, but have never used R; or perhaps you know a little about R, but are new to machine learning. In any case, this book will get you up and running quickly. It would be helpful to have a bit of familiarity with basic math and programming concepts, but no prior experience is required. All you need is curiosity.

## Get to Know the Author
**Brett Lantz**
 has spent more than 10 years using innovative data methods to understand human behavior. A trained sociologist, he was frst enchanted by machine learning while studying a large database of teenagers' social networking website profles. Since then, Brett has worked on interdisciplinary studies of cellular telephone calls, medical billing data, and philanthropic activity, among others. When not spending time with family, following college sports, or being entertained by his dachshunds, he maintains a website dedicated to sharing knowledge about the search for insight in data.
